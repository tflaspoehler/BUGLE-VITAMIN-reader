# BUGLE-VITAMIN-reader
## Introduction
Here I have a python class that reads cross-sections libraries with the 'bcd' file extension with shielding libraries in mind. 

The fine-group VITAMIN and coarse-group BUGLE libraries are multigroup shielding libraries that have useful cross sections for different isotopes and compositions that have been collapsed for different regions of typical shielding materials. 

Updated versions are available through RSICC where they are developed by the transport group that develops SCALE. The MAVRIC shielding library is based on this with a higher energy group to go to 20MeV for neutrons (and maybe photons). The same libraries from MAVRIC are provided in ADVANTG.
